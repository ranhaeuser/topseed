# topseed - seed project

Topseed aims to be a showcase of best practices and approaches for developers and designers who want to build stunning mobile-first web apps with some of the best technologies available now.

What technologies make our cut? Those that let us be the most
productive and creative. And that we know to be maintainable. And that we expect to be future-safe.

We welcome scrutiny and feedback from anyone who tries to follow our approaches. We also welcome code contributions from seasoned designers and developers.

## Some best practices demonstrated:
1. Apply design guidelines (e.g. Material Design, MUICSS) for beauty and consistency
2. Use SASS, BEM and Preprocessors for clean and maintainable CSS
3. Use Pug to improve reuse and make your HTML more maintainable (static or node)
4. Go max. static; deploy to CDN edge cache to scale for performance
5. Use AppShell and page transitions for SPA/rich client feel AND SEO
6. Use AMP to speed up time-to-glass with viewport rendering and early completion
7. Be DOM-centric to be more friendly with team that includes interactive designers that code
8. Use PageBusiness, Promises and Fetch(microservice) for cleaner code
9. Use Web Component libraries _in ways that avoid lock-in_
10. Use Phonegap/Cordova in-app browser for efficient Mobile apps
11. Use Server-side rendering (SSR) for extreme SEO
