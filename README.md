# topseed - seed project

Topseed aims to be a showcase of best practices and approaches for developers and designers who want to build stunning mobile-first web apps with some of the best technologies available now.

What technologies make our cut? Those that let us be the most
productive and creative. And that we know to be maintainable. And that we expect to be future-safe.

We welcome scrutiny and feedback from anyone who tries to follow our approaches. We also welcome code contributions from seasoned designers and developers.

## Some best practices demonstrated:
- DOM-centric to be more friendly with team that includes interactive designers that code
- Use page transitions for a Single Page Application (SPA) feel that works with SEO
- Can be static (serverless), deployed to CDN edge cache to scale (fetch() microservices)
- Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) that can boost SEO, in same or separate subdomain
- Native Mobile Apps 
- Server side data-binding(SSR) and in-browser data binding
- Use web component libraries: <http://jeffcarp.github.io/frontend-hyperpolyglot>
- Use Material Design, SASS, and BEM Standard
- Use Pug to improve reuse and reduce maintenance costs.
